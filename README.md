# README
  
This is demo app to learn js / ujs / ajax approaches, with or without jquery, with or without turbolinks, at rails.

## TODOs:

* done: inserts & deletes; yet to finish: edits & show

* learn to DRY-up & modularize js right way

* for ajax crud, use (same?) partial from js; now it uses no partials

* json to use

* search functionality

* DnD + ajax
